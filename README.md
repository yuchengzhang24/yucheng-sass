## Project setup with degit

An easy way to use download and use a template from a repo is [degit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit), which ICJ students should have installed when they set up Node.

- Create your local project folder.
- In a terminal from inside the folder, run `degit utdata/icj-sass-template`.
- Run `npm install` to install dependences.
- Run `gulp dev` to run Sass and start the development server.

For further directions, see the [Sass lesson](https://github.com/utdata/icj-class#sass).
